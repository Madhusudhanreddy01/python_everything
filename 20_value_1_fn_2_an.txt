value from 1 to another function in python

To pass a value from one function to another function in Python, you can do the following:

    Define the first function and the value you want to pass as a parameter:

python

def function1(value):
    # code for function1

    Within the first function, call the second function and pass the value as an argument:

python

def function1(value):
    function2(value)

    Define the second function and include the value as a parameter:

python

def function2(value):
    # code for function2 using the value parameter

    When you call the first function, pass the value you want to use as an argument:

python

function1(42)

In the example above, we are passing the value 42 from function1 to function2. You can replace 42 with any value you want to pass.
