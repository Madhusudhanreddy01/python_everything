What is __init__ in python 

__init__ is a special method in Python classes that is used to initialize the object's attributes. 
It is also known as a constructor method because it is called automatically when an object of the class is created. 
The __init__ method takes at least one parameter, which is usually called self and refers to the instance of the class being created.

Inside the __init__ method, you can define the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes. 
These attributes are specific to the instance of the class and can be accessed using the dot notation, for example self.attribute.

Here's an example of a class with an __init__ method:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

In this example, the Person class has two attributes, name and age, which are initialized using the parameters passed to the __init__ method. 
When a new Person object is created, these attributes will be set to the specified values.
