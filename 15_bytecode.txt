What is bytecode in python

Bytecode in Python is an intermediate representation of the code that is generated by the Python interpreter when a program is compiled. 
The bytecode is a lower-level representation of the code than the original source code, but is still human-readable.

When you write a Python program, it is compiled into bytecode when it is executed. 
The bytecode is then interpreted by the Python virtual machine (PVM), which executes the instructions in the bytecode.

The bytecode is stored in a file with a .pyc extension in the __pycache__ directory. 
When you run the same program again, Python will first check if a compiled bytecode file exists for the source code, and if it does, 
it will load the bytecode from the file instead of recompiling the source code.

Bytecode is platform-independent, which means that the same bytecode file can be run on any platform that has a compatible version of Python installed. 
This makes it possible to distribute Python programs as bytecode files, rather than as source code, which can be a way to protect intellectual property.

While bytecode is not as readable as source code, it is still possible to decompile bytecode back into source code using various tools, 
although the resulting code may not be identical to the original source code.
