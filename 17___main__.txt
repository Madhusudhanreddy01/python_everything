What is __main__ in python

__main__ is a special name in Python that is used to refer to the main module or program that is being executed. 
It is the name of the scope in which the top-level code executes, including statements that are not part of any function or class definition. 
When a Python script is run directly, it is considered the main module, and its __name__ attribute is set to '__main__'.

For example, consider a simple Python script named example.py:

def my_function():
    print('Hello, world!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    my_function()

In this script, the my_function function is defined, 
and then there is an if statement that checks whether the __name__ attribute of the module is equal to '__main__'. 
If it is, the my_function function is called.

When you run this script using the command python example.py, 
the __name__ attribute of the module is set to '__main__', and the my_function function is called.

Using __name__ == '__main__' in this way allows you to write code that can be both imported as a module and run as a standalone program. 
By checking the value of __name__, you can ensure that certain parts of the code are only executed when the module is run as a standalone program, 
and not when it is imported as a module.
