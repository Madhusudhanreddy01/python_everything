Python Garbage Collection:
A module represents Python code that performs a specific task. 
Garbage collector is a module in Python that is useful to delete objects from memory which are not used in the program.

The module that represents the garbage collector is named as gc. 
Garbage collector in the simplest way to maintain a count for each object regarding how many times that object is referenced (or used).

When an object is referenced twice, its reference count will be 2.

When an object has some count, it is being used in the program and hence garbage collector will not remove it from memory.

When an object is found with a reference count 0, garbage collector will understand that the object is not used by the program and hence it can be deleted from memory.

Hence, the memory allocated for that object is deallocated or freed.
