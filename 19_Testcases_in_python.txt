What is unittest in python

unittest is a testing framework in Python that allows you to write and run unit tests for your Python code. 
It is part of the Python standard library, so it is available with every Python installation.

Unit testing is a software testing technique in which individual units or components of a software system 
are tested in isolation to ensure that they function correctly. 
In Python, a unit is typically a single function or method.

unittest provides a set of tools for writing and running unit tests. 
You can define test cases by subclassing the unittest.TestCase class and using its methods to test your code. 
For example, you can use the assertEqual method to test that two values are equal, 
the assertTrue method to test that a Boolean expression is true, and so on.

Here is an example of a simple test case defined using unittest:

css

import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAdd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

In this example, the TestAdd class inherits from unittest.TestCase and defines a test_add method that tests the add function. 
The if __name__ == '__main__': block at the end of the script runs the test case using the unittest.main() function.

unittest provides many other tools for testing your code, including support for fixtures, test suites, and test runners. 
By writing and running unit tests with unittest, you can ensure that your code works as expected and avoid introducing new bugs when making changes.

how to check test cases in python

To check test cases in Python, you can use a testing framework such as unittest, pytest, or doctest. 
Here's a brief overview of how to use each of these frameworks:

    unittest: This is a built-in testing framework in Python, which allows you to write test cases in a class-based structure. 
Here's an example:

python

import unittest

class TestStringMethods(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_upper(self):
        self.assertEqual('hello'.upper(), 'HELLO')

    def test_isupper(self):
        self.assertTrue('HELLO'.isupper())
        self.assertFalse('Hello'.isupper())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

In the example above, we define a test case class TestStringMethods and include two test methods, test_upper and test_isupper. 
We use the assert method to check that the output of the tested function matches the expected result.

    pytest: This is a popular testing framework in Python, which allows you to write test cases in a function-based structure. 
Here's an example:

python

import pytest

def test_upper():
    assert 'hello'.upper() == 'HELLO'

def test_isupper():
    assert 'HELLO'.isupper()
    assert not 'Hello'.isupper()

In the example above, we define two test functions test_upper and test_isupper and use the assert statement 
to check that the output of the tested function matches the expected result.

    doctest: This is a built-in testing framework in Python, which allows you to write test cases within the documentation of your code. 
Here's an example:

python

def square(x):
    """
    This function returns the square of a number.

    >>> square(2)
    4
    >>> square(3)
    9
    """
    return x**2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

In the example above, we include test cases within the documentation of the square function using the >>> notation. 
We then use the doctest module to run the tests and check that the output of the tested function matches the expected result.

These are just a few examples of how to check test cases in Python. 
You can choose the framework that best suits your needs and preferences.
