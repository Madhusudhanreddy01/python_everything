What is __pycache__ in python

__pycache__ is a directory that is automatically created by Python to store compiled bytecode files (.pyc) when a module is imported for the first time. 
When a module is imported, Python compiles the module into bytecode and stores it in the __pycache__ directory for future use. 
The bytecode is platform-specific and is used to speed up the loading of the module the next time it is imported.

The __pycache__ directory is created in the same directory as the module that is being compiled. 
For example, if you have a module named example.py in a directory called my_module, the __pycache__ directory will be created as my_module/__pycache__/.

Each bytecode file is named with the pattern module_name.version.pyc, 
where module_name is the name of the module, version is the Python version used to compile the bytecode, 
and .pyc is the extension used for the compiled bytecode file.

It's safe to delete the __pycache__ directory if you want to clear out the compiled bytecode files. 
Python will recompile the modules the next time they are imported. 
However, this will cause a small delay in loading the modules, as Python will have to recompile them.
